# online_private_bank_statement_analyser
An expression of my [bank statement analysis logic](https://github.com/jackwaddington/joint-account-analyser) with a web interface.

I was thinking about what processing power we have with JavaScript in a browser, and that we could probably process CSVs locally (security benefit?) and share with others the ability to make this basic but powerful analysis to understand where our money goes.

I have a hunch also that this is easy to host, as there is nothing funky going one with cloud?

As I am pressed for time, with so many things I would like to explore and build I stop this short of being able to handle multiple formats of bank statements and leave it as is.

I am really impressed with what is possible here, and how much easier this is than what I have done with spreadsheets for years.
